# Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Self-Management Bootstrap

### Goals
- Establish runnable Projitive governance for this repo.
- Enable one-step agent execution loop driven by `task.next`.

### Milestones
- [ ] ROADMAP-0001: Governance baseline and task loop operational (time: 2026-Q1)
- [ ] ROADMAP-0002: Spec v1.1 proposal and release checklist prepared (time: 2026-Q1)
- [ ] ROADMAP-0003: Continuous governance quality checks integrated (time: 2026-Q2)

### Risks
- ID drift between roadmap/tasks/designs/reports.
- Tasks updated without report evidence.

### Dependencies
- MCP toolchain under `packages/mcp/` remains test-green.
- Governance artifacts stay in `.projitive/` only.
