# Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Initial Setup

### Goals
- Establish basic governance structure
- Create first tasks with evidence
- Demonstrate complete Projitive workflow

### Milestones
- [x] ROADMAP-0001: Project initialized with .projitive marker
- [ ] ROADMAP-0002: First task completed with evidence
- [ ] ROADMAP-0003: Full workflow demonstrated (discover → execute → report)

### Risks
- Tasks updated without report evidence
- ID drift between roadmap/tasks/designs/reports

### Dependencies
- Governance artifacts stay in .projitive/ only
